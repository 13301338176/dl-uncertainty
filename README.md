## Uncertainty in Deep Learning
Some code based on the paper:

A Kendall, Y Gal, “**What Uncertainties Do We Need in Bayesian Deep Learning for Computer Vision?**”, NIPS 2017 [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04977)

This is __NOT__ the official repo. It is just based on my understanding of the paper.
